\section{Conclusion}

An extension to the AADL language has been developed with tool support for formal analysis of system safety properties in the presence of faults. Faulty behavior is specified as an extension of the nominal model, allowing safety analysis and system implementation to be driven from a single common model. This new Safety Annex leverages the AADL structural model and nominal behavioral specification (using the AGREE annex) to propagate faulty component behaviors without the need to add separate propagation specifications to the model.   Next steps will include extensions to automate injection of Byzantine faults as well as automatic generation of fault trees.  For more details on the tool, models, and approach, see the technical report and the repository~\cite{SATechReport, amaseRepo}.
