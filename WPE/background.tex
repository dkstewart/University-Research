\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:background}
One of our goals is to transition the tools we have developed into use by the safety engineers who perform safety assessment of avionics products. Therefore, we need to understand how the tools and the models will fit into the existing safety assessment and certification process. Part of this understanding involves taking a look at pertinent background information in safety analysis.
