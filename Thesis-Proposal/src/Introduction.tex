Safety critical systems are an increasingly important topic in our modern age. From nuclear power plants and airplanes to heart monitors and automobiles, critical systems are vitally important in our society. With a rise in technological advances also comes an increased need for reliable safety analysis methods and tools. Standardized methods of safety analysis have been used for many years and various tools and methods are currently applied to the topic in both industrial and academic settings. System safety analysis techniques are well-established and are a required activity in the development of safety-critical systems. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) methods and tools based on formal methods now permit system-level requirements to be specified and analyzed early in the system development process~\cite{NFM2012:CoGaMiWhLaLu,CAV2015:BoCiGrMa}. While model-based development methods are widely used in the aerospace industry, they are only recently being applied to system safety analysis.  

This paper describes a behavioral approach to safety analysis using an architecture description language called Architecture Analysis and Design Language. We describe a {\em Safety Annex} for the Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL)~\cite{FeilerModelBasedEngineering2012} that provides the ability to reason about faults and faulty component behaviors in AADL models. In the Safety Annex approach, we use formal assume-guarantee contracts to define the nominal behavior of system components. The nominal model is then verified using the Assume Guarantee Reasoning Environment (AGREE)~\cite{NFM2012:CoGaMiWhLaLu}. The Safety Annex  provides a way to weave faults into the nominal system model and analyze the behavior of the system in the presence of faults. The Safety Annex also provides a library of common fault node definitions that is customizable to the needs of system and safety engineers. Our approach adapts the work of Joshi et. al~\cite{Joshi05:Dasc} to the AADL modeling language, and provides a domain specific language for the kinds of analysis performed manually in previous work~\cite{Stewart17:IMBSA}. 


The Safety Annex supports model checking and quantitative reasoning by attaching behavioral faults to components and then using the normal behavioral propagation and proof mechanisms built into the AGREE AADL annex. This allows users to reason about the evolution of faults over time, and produce counterexamples demonstrating how component faults lead to system failures. It can serve as the shared model to capture system design and safety-relevant information, and produce both qualitative and quantitative description of the causal relationship between faults/failures and system safety requirements.
