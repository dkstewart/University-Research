\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:intro}

System safety analysis is crucial in the development life cycle of critical systems to ensure adequate safety as well as demonstrate compliance with applicable standards. A prerequisite for any safety analysis is a thorough understanding of the system architecture and the behavior of its components; safety engineers use this understanding to explore the system behavior to ensure safe operation, assess the effect of failures on the overall safety objectives, and construct the accompanying safety analysis artifacts. Developing adequate understanding, especially for software components, is a difficult and time consuming endeavor. Given the increase in model-based development in critical systems~\cite{Joshi05:Dasc,CAV2015:BoCiGrMa,info17:HaLuHo,5979344,Gudemann:2010:FQQ:1909626.1909813}, leveraging the resultant models in the safety analysis process, as well as automating the generation of safety analysis artifacts, holds great promise in terms of analysis accuracy as well as efficiency.

In this proposal, we describe a Model Based Safety Analysis (MBSA) approach to critical system development in which the safety analysis is tied directly to the system model and the flexibility of the analysis provides various ways of capturing error propagation information, single points of failures, and combinations of faults that can cause a system failure. Furthermore, we propose a novel way to utilize the verification information used during the system development process in order to automate the generation of both qualitative and quantitative safety analysis artifacts. 

Our long range goal is to support a model-based safety assessment process backed by formal methods to help safety engineers with early detection of design issues. This process uses a single unified model to support both system design and safety analysis. \textbf{The objective of this proposal}, which is a logical step towards our goal, is to define a safety analysis tool that allows for flexible fault modeling and fits into the MBSA approach, and furthermore to formally prove a relationship between verification results and safety analysis artifacts.

There are two main pieces of this research work. The first is the research and development of a safety analysis tool that works closely with existing verification engines. The second is to define algorithms and formulate theoretical proofs that make use of verification results in order to extract information about the fault model.  

We plan to accomplish the objectives of this proposal by pursuing the following aims:

Define and implment a Safety Annex to enable faul modeling in AADL. UNderstnad the mdoelign needs, define a langueg extension, implement a tool to process it. 

Define copositional verification capabiliteis in the face of component failures. Analysis for number of faults model and lower than YY\% probablility model. 

Define compositioanl computation of minimal cut sets: Define here or earlier. Define, prove, and implement.

Define accurate capositional probability compustiaons for the top-level events. Define, prove, and implement.

Evalluate:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Define a grammar for a safety analysis tool that will work closely with a standard modeling language that has existing support for formal verification.} The grammar will formally define a user-friendly syntax that will still allow for rich fault models. The analyst will be able to wrap a fault around the output of a component such that the fault model has access to certain elements of the system components while still providing separation between the fault model and the nominal system model. The grammar should extend a standard system modeling language to provide ease in the integration of these languages and supporting tool framework. 

\item \textbf{Determine how to capture behavioral and explicit error propagation through the use of formal verification techniques.} Given a complex model with numerous interactions, it becomes difficult to realize all possible effects of an active fault in the system; therefore, it is necessary to be able to provide behavioral error propagation within the system model. That being said, at times it is also helpful to explicitly state how an error propagates, for example when components are physically co-located but logically modeled separately. Thus having the capability to represent and model both types of propagation is valuable to an analyst. Research will need to be performed to determine how the effects of an active fault can be propagated through the contracts of the system's subcomponents; additionally, it is necessary to see exactly how this propagation will effect the system level properties. 

\item \textbf{Provide evidence through the use of representative system models how the fault analysis performed in tandem with formal verification methods can generate valuable information used in the safety assessment process.} Given that the tool will be closely related to the verification process, the model checker will be able to provide pertinant fault model information. This will allow feedback on system traces when faults are active, specific counterexamples showing the state of the system when a property is violated, and single points of failure of a system. These types of system traces will allow an analyst to see specifically and clearly which subcomponents are at risk, what the overall effect a subcomponent's behavior has on a system requirement, and will allow faster analysis than manual efforts can perform. 

\item \textbf{Develop formal proofs that certain traceability information gathered through the nominal system model verification process can be leveraged to generate safety analysis artifacts.} Certain safety analysis artifacts require much more than a counterexample or an example of a single point of failure. It is not only useful, but often required for critical system certification, to show all combinations of failures that can contribute to violation of a safety property (\textit{minimal cut sets}). These sets of faults are often computationally expensive to find and no other safety analysis tool provides a way to perform this computation in a \textit{compositional} way. We will formally prove that a relationship exists between the proof cores of the nominal model and minimal cut sets, and then use these formal results to compositionally generate safety artifacts. 

%We will use elements available through the compositional proof process in order to capture fault model information and find all \textit{minimal cut sets} of a safety property (minimal combinations of faults that cause property violation). 
\item \textbf{Research the possibility of finding the overall probability of the violation of a safety property, and generate upper and lower bounds of the system wide failure probability.} It is desirable to find the probability of system failure or property violation and these quantitative results are often required in the safety assessment process. We will discuss valuable approaches to computing the exact probability of property violation and possible difficulties in finding or using this number. Furthermore, we will explore methods and formal algorithms for leveraging the compositionally derived minimal cut sets in order to compute upper and lower bounds for the actual probability of system failure.
