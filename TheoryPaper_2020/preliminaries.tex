In this paper we consider \emph{safety properties} over infinite-state machines. The states are vectors of boolean variables that define the values of state variables. We assume there are a set of legal \emph{initial states} and the safety property is specified as a propositional formula over state variables. A \emph{reachable state space} means that all states are reachable from the initial state. 

Given a state space $U$, a transition system $(I,T)$ consists of an
initial state predicate $I : U \to \bool$ and a transition step
predicate $T : U \times U \to \bool$.
We define the notion of
reachability for $(I, T)$ as the smallest predicate $\reach : U \to
\bool$ which satisfies the following formulas:
\begin{gather*}
  \forall u.~ I(u) \Rightarrow \reach(u) \\
  \forall u, u'.~ \reach(u) \land T(u, u') \Rightarrow \reach(u')
\end{gather*}
A safety property $P : U \to \bool$ is a state predicate. A safety
property $P$ holds on a transition system $(I, T)$ if it holds on all
reachable states, i.e., $\forall u.~ \reach(u) \Rightarrow P(u)$,
written as $\reach \Rightarrow P$ for short. When this is the case, we
write $(I, T)\vdash P$.

\subsection{Induction}
\danielle{This section  is likely far longer than what it needs to be for this paper. We really just need a brief intro on induction before hitting sec 3.2. Will do a shortening - just wanted to write it all out for my own sake (and thesis sake). But I think we still need a paragraph linking transition systems to the SAT problem. Easy to do without all this verbage.}
For an arbitrary transition system $(I, T)$, computing reachability
can be very expensive or even impossible. Thus, we need a more
effective way of checking if a safety property $P$ is satisfied by the
system. The key idea is to over-approximate reachability. If we can
find an over-approximation that implies the property, then the
property must hold. Otherwise, the approximation needs to be refined.

A good first approximation for reachability is the property itself.
That is, we can check if the following formulas hold:
\begin{gather}
  \forall s.~ I(s) \Rightarrow P(s)
  \label{eq:1-ind-base} \\
  \forall s, s'.~ P(s) \land T(s, s') \Rightarrow P(s')
  \label{eq:1-ind-step}
\end{gather}
If both formulas hold then $P$ is {\em inductive} and holds over the
system. If (\ref{eq:1-ind-base}) fails to hold, then $P$ is violated
by an initial state of the system. If (\ref{eq:1-ind-step}) fails to
hold, then $P$ is too much of an over-approximation and needs to be
refined.

The JKind model checker used in this research uses {\em
  $k$-induction} which unrolls the property over $k$ steps of the
transition system. For example, 1-induction consists of formulas
(\ref{eq:1-ind-base}) and (\ref{eq:1-ind-step}) above, whereas
2-induction consists of the following formulas:
\begin{gather*}
\forall s.~ I(s) \Rightarrow P(s) \\
\forall s, s'.~ I(s) \land T(s, s') \Rightarrow P(s') \\
\forall s, s', s''.~ P(s) \land T(s, s') \land P(s') \land T(s',
  s'') \Rightarrow P(s'')
\end{gather*}
That is, there are two base step checks and one inductive step check.
In general, for an arbitrary $k$, $k$-induction consists of $k$
base step checks and one inductive step check as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:k-induction} (the universal quantifiers on $s_i$ have
been elided for space). We say that a property is $k$-inductive if it
satisfies the $k$-induction constraints for the given value of $k$.
The hope is that the additional formulas in the antecedent of the
inductive step make it provable.

\begin{figure}
\begin{gather*}
I(s_0) \Rightarrow P(s_0) \\[-2pt]
%
\vdots \\[2pt]
%
I(s_0) \land T(s_0, s_1) \land \cdots \land T(s_{k-2}, s_{k-1})
\Rightarrow P(s_{k-1}) \\[2pt]
%
P(s_0) \land T(s_0, s_1) \land \cdots \land P(s_{k-1}) \land
T(s_{k-1}, s_k) \Rightarrow P(s_k)
\end{gather*}

  step}

In practice, inductive model checkers often use a combination of the
above techniques. Thus, a typical conclusion is of the form ``$P$ with
lemmas $L_1, \ldots, L_n$ is $k$-inductive''.

\subsection{The SAT Problem}
Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solvers attempt to determine if there exists a total truth assignment to a given propositional formula, that evaluates to TRUE. Generally, a propositional formula is any combination of the disjunction and conjunction of literals (as an example, $a$ and $\neg a$ are literals). For a given unsatisfiable problem, solvers try to generate a proof of unsatisfiability; this is generally more useful than a proof of satisfiability. Such a proof is dependent on identifying a subset of clauses that make the problem unsatisfiable (UNSAT). 

SAT solvers in model checking work over a constraint system to determine satisfiability. A \textit{constraint system} $C$ is an ordered set of $n$ abstract constraints $\{C_1, C_2, ..., C_n\}$ over a set of variables. The constraint $C_i$ restricts the allowed assignments of these variables in some way~\cite{liffiton2016fast}. Given a constraint system, we require some method of determining, for any subset $S \subseteq C$, whether $S$ is \textit{satisfiable} (SAT) or \textit{unsatisfiable} (UNSAT). When a subset $S$ is SAT, this means that there exists an assignment allowed by all $C_i \in S$; when no such assignment exists, $S$ is considered UNSAT. 

There are several ways of translating a propositional formula into clauses such that satisfiability is preserved~\cite{een2003temporal}. By performing this translation, $k$-inductive model checkers are able to utilize parallel SAT-solving engines to glean information about the proof of a safety property at each inductive step. Expression of the base and induction steps of a temporal induction proof as SAT problems is straightforward. As an example, we look at an arbitrary base case from Figure~\ref{fig:k-induction}.

\begin{gather*}
I(s_0) \land T(s_0, s_1) \land \cdots \land T(s_{k-2}, s_{k-1})
\land \neg P(s_{k-1})
\end{gather*}

When proving correctness it is shown that the formulas are \emph{unsatisfiable}. If an $n^{th}$ inductive-step is unsatisfiable, that means following an $n$-step trace where the property holds, there exists no next state where it fails, i.e., the property $P$ is provable.
