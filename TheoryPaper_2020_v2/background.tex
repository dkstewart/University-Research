\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}
In order to formalize the approach of this research, some background information must be supplied. Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solvers attempt to determine if there exists a total truth assignment to a given propositional formula, that evaluates to TRUE. Generally, a propositional formula is any combination of the disjunction and conjunction of literals (as an example, $a$ and $\neg a$ are literals). For a given unsatisfiable problem, solvers try to generate a proof of unsatisfiability; this is generally more useful than a proof of satisfiability. Such a proof is dependent on identifying a subset of clauses that make the problem unsatisfiable (UNSAT). 

SAT solvers in model checking work over a constraint system to determine satisfiability. A \textit{constraint system} $C$ is an ordered set of $n$ abstract constraints $\{C_1, C_2, ..., C_n\}$ over a set of variables. The constraint $C_i$ restricts the allowed assignments of these variables in some way~\cite{liffiton2016fast}. Given a constraint system, we require some method of determining, for any subset $S \subseteq C$, whether $S$ is \textit{satisfiable} (SAT) or \textit{unsatisfiable} (UNSAT). When a subset $S$ is SAT, this means that there exists an assignment allowed by all $C_i \in S$; when no such assignment exists, $S$ is considered UNSAT. 

The \aivcalg algorithm adapts the MARCO scheme~\cite{liffiton2016fast} which generates all MUSs and applies the idea to sequential model checking~\cite{Ghassabani2017EfficientGO}. Thus, MIVCs are MUSs for inductive systems. \danielle{<-- wording?}

Such a constraint system can encode our example. Consider the first layer of analysis (top level of the system): $C = \{g_p, g_t, g_r, \neg P\}$. This constraint system describes the supporting guarantees at the lower level and the constrained safety property at the top level. The reason for the constraint on $P$ is due to the formulation of the constraint system by the model checker we use, JKind. JKind attempts to look at the unsatisfiability of the problem in order to produce proof results. \danielle{I don't like this description - it can be better. Look over these sentences.}

Given a constraint system $C$, there are certain subsets of $C$ that are of interest in terms of satisfiability. Definitions 2-4 are taken from research by Liffiton et al.,~\cite{liffiton2016fast}. 

\begin{definition} : A Minimal Unsatisfiable Subset (MUS) $M$ of a constraint system $C$ is a subset $M \subseteq C$ such that $M$ is unsatisfiable and $\forall c \in M$ : $M \setminus \{c\}$ is satisfiable. 
\end{definition}
\noindent
An MUS can be intuitively understood as the minimal explanation of the constraint systems infeasability. 

Returning to our running example, this can be illustrated by the following. Given the constraint system $C = \{g_p, g_t, g_r, \neg P\}$, one minimal explanation of the infeasability of this system is the set $\{g_p, g_t, g_r,\}$. If all three guarantees can be violated, then there exists an assignment for all elements such that the system is satisfiable. Given that $P$ is an ``OR" statement of all three guarantees, in order to satisfy $\neg P$, all three guarantees must be violated. Due to the level of the architecture under analysis, there are no faults in the system, but instead only guarantees that may be violated. This is always the case with logical subsystems in a compositional approach. 

\begin{definition} : A Minimal Correction Set (MCS) $M$ of a constraint system $C$ is a subset $M\subseteq C$ such that $C \setminus M$ is satisfiable and $\forall S \subset M$ : $C \setminus S$ is unsatisfiable. 
\end{definition}
\noindent
A MCS can be seen to ``correct'' the infeasability of the constraint system by the removal from $C$ the constraints found in an MCS.

Returning to the PWR example, we can see that if all three guarantees hold, then the safety property $P$ will also hold, i.e., the nominal model is verified. But the constraint system is in terms of $\neg P$ which clearly gives an unsatisfiable constraint system. In this case, we may ask: what will correct this unsatisfiability? These are the MCSs for this constraint system: $MCS_1 = \{g_t\}$, $MCS_2 = \{g_p\}$, $MCS_3 = \{g_r\}$. 

A duality exists between the MUSs of a constraint system and the MCSs as established by Reiter \cite{reiter1987theory}. This duality is defined in terms of \textit{Minimal Hitting Sets} (\textit{MHS}). A hitting set of a collection of sets $A$ is a set $H$ such that every set in $A$ is ``hit'' by $H$; $H$ contains at least one element from every set in $A$. Every MUS of a constraint system is a minimal hitting set of the system's MCSs, and likewise every MCS is a minimal hitting set of the system's MUSs~\cite{liffiton2016fast, reiter1987theory, de1987diagnosing}.

For the PWR top level constraint system, it can be seen that each of the MCSs intersected with the MUS is nonempty. 

Since we are interested in sets of active faults that cause violation of the safety property, we turn our attention to Minimal Cut Sets. 
\begin{definition}
A \textit{Minimal Cut Set} (MinCutSet) is a minimal collection of faults that lead to the violation of the safety property. Furthermore, any subset of a MinCutSet will not cause this property violation. 
\end{definition}
\noindent
We define a minimal cut set consistently with much of the research in this field~\cite{fta:survey,historyFTA}.

\subsection{Inductive Validity Cores}
Given a safety property, a model checker can be invoked in order to construct a proof of the property.  It is often useful to extract traceability information related to the proof, in
other words, which portions of the model were necessary to construct the proof.  Minimal Inductive Validity Cores (MIVCs) describe the minimal
model elements necessary for the inductive proof of a safety property for a sequential system~\cite{GhassabaniGW16}.  MIVCs can be considered a generalization of UNSAT cores for sequential systems.  Further work extended the MIVC algorithms to produce all mimimal sets of MIVC elements (\aivcalg)~\cite{Ghassabani2017EfficientGO,bendik2018online}.  These algorithms are incorporated into the JKind model checker~\cite{2017arXiv171201222G} which is given a model in the dataflow programming language Lustre~\cite{Halbwachs91:IEEE} 

The \aivcalg algorithm collects all minimal unsatisfiable subsets of a given transition system in terms of the \textit{negation} of the top level property~\cite{Ghassabani2017EfficientGO,bendik2018online}. Assuming that the nominal model proves (no faults are active), it is not surprising that the model elements (guarantees and assumptions of components) and the negation of the safety property is UNSAT. The MUSs are the minimal explanation of the infeasibility of this constraint system; equivalently, these are the minimal sets of model elements necessary for proof of the safety property.

\subsection{High Level Overview of the Main Idea}

We utilize the \aivcalg algorithm by providing not only component contracts as model elements, but also faults constrained to \textit{false}, i.e., the faults are inactive. We first check that the property is true of the system when no faults occur; if not, then the system must be repaired until the property is true before starting this analysis.  With this assumption, the resulting the resulting MIVCs (MUSs) will contain the required contracts and constrained faults necessary to prove the safety property. A high level summary of the steps of this transformation are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:trans}.

\end{figure*}

Returning to the PWR example, we focus now on a lower layer of analysis -- proving the guarantee at the temperature subsystem level. The constraint system will now consist of constrained faults of the sensors and the negation of the property of interest $g_t$: $C = \{\neg f_{t1}, \neg f_{t2}, \neg f_{t3}, \neg g_t\}$. 

The MIVCs (or MUSs) of this sytem correspond to all pairs of faults constrained to faults due to the majority voting mechanism. Simply put, if any two faults \emph{occur}, then the negation of $g_t$ is satisfiable. 

Because of the duality between MUSs and MCSs, all MCSs can be obtained by finding the hitting sets of all MUSs. The MCS can be seen to correct the infeasibility of the constraint system and provides the minimal such correction. By removing the constraints from $C$ that are found in any MCS, $C$ becomes satisfiable. In terms of the constraint system that includes fault activation literals, by \textit{activating} the faults in the MCS and \textit{violating} the contracts in the MCS, we can demonstrate the \textit{negation} of the property $P$. 

To illustrate, notice that in the PWR example, all MIVCs are given as: 
$$\boxed{
	\begin{aligned}
		MIVC_1(g_t) = \{\neg f_{t1}, \neg f_{t2}\} \\
		MIVC_2(g_t) = \{\neg f_{t1}, \neg f_{t3}\} \\
		MIVC_3(g_t) = \{\neg f_{t2}, \neg f_{t3}\}
	\end{aligned}
}$$

The hitting sets of all MIVCs are: 
 $$\boxed{
	\begin{aligned}
		MCS_1 = \{\neg f_{t1}, \neg f_{t2}\} \\
		MCS_2 = \{\neg f_{t1}, \neg f_{t3}\} \\
		MCS_3 = \{\neg f_{t2}, \neg f_{t3}\}
	\end{aligned}
}$$

By removing the constraints from the elements in each MCS, we have the ``correction" to the infeasible constraint system; an assignment exists such that $\neg g_t$ is satisfiable. These are the minimal cut sets for $g_t$. 

In summary, if the contracts in the MCS are replaced with the faults that cause its violation, the MCS can be transformed into a MinCutSet.
