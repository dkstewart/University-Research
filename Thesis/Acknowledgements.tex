Thank you to my advisors Mats and Mike, and committee members Darren, Antonia, and John. I appreciate the guidance you have provided. Darren, thank you for taking me under your wing and teaching me the ropes of critical system research these past years.\\

My grandmother, Patricia. You taught me to search for knowledge.  My never ending questions were always met with: ``let's look it up." You encouraged my intellect in ways no one else did. \\

Mom and Dad, you both helped me build a foundation that has withstood the winds of life. Russ, thank you for the support you've given. Gabriella and Erich, our D\&D nights have simply kicked ass. Tony, Anna, Nathan, Josiah, Ella, Judah, and Christian: my awesome brothers and sisters---life would be lame without you all... also quieter. And Todd, you are my encouragement. \\

Thank you all. Really.
