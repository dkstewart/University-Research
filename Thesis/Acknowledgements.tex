Thank you to my advisors Mats and Mike, and committee members Darren, Antonia, and John. I appreciate the guidance you have provided.\\

My grandmother, Patricia. You taught me to search for knowledge.  My never ending questions were always met with: ``let's look it up." You encouraged my intellect in ways no one else did. Russell, you have been a great support. Todd, you are my encouragement. Ella and Erich, our D\&D nights kept me sane. And finally, Josiah and Alex. I would not have made it without you both. 

Thank you all. Really.
