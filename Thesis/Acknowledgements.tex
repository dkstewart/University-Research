Thank you to my advisors Mats and Mike, and committee members Darren, Antonia, and John. I couldn't have done this without your support.

My grandmother, Patricia. You taught me to search for knowledge.  My never ending questions were always met with: ``look it up." You encouraged my intellect in ways no one else did. And finally, my wonderful brother Josiah and Alex. I would not have made it to today without you both. Thank you. Really.
