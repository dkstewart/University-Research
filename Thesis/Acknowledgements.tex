Thank you to my advisors Mats and Mike, and committee members Darren, Antonia, and John. I appreciate the guidance you have provided. Darren, thank you for taking me under your wing and teaching me the ropes of critical systems and research these past years.\\

My grandmother, Patricia. You taught me to search for knowledge.  My never ending questions were always met with: ``let's look it up." You encouraged my intellect in ways no one else did. \\

Russ, thank you for your support. Ella and Erich, our D\&D nights kept me sane. Tony, Anna, Nathan, Josiah, Ella, Judah, and Christian: my awesome brothers and sisters. Todd, you are my encouragement. Thank you all. Really.
