When I first began my journey into the great land of the PhD, my background was quite different than safety analysis and it took a number of months to feel even slightly comfortable in this new landscape. I could not have done that without the patient and kind help of Michael Whalen and Darren Cofer. A huge thank you to both of you for this support. You provided an environment in which it was fun to ask questions, easy to learn, and exciting to explore new places. I am forever grateful. 

I also want to thank Mats Heimdahl for your willingness to take me on as your student when the time came for Mike to move on. Despite your busy schedule, you always find time for my questions and ideas. Thank you. 

And lastly, thank you to Antonia Zhai and John Sartori for reading these words, having insights and questions for me to ponder, and taking time to support my studies. Thanks for being on my committee!
