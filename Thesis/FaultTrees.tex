\subsection{Fault Trees and Minimal Cut Sets}
\label{sec:saArtifacts}
\danielle{Move this paragraph to where it makes sense.} Safety analysis has traditionally been performed manually, but with the rise of model checking and the improvement of its capabilities, the world of safety analysis began to see its powerful benefits~\cite{hinchey2012industrial, liggesmeyer1998improving, coudert1993fault, Bozzano:2010:DSA:1951720,bozzano2003esacs}. There arose multiple ways of viewing the system and fault models, various ways of automating the capture of safety pertinent information, and a number of tools that addressed various issues that arose. In this section, we discuss the state of the practice and how formal methods has been applied in the domain of safety assessment research.

Since the early days of safety engineering, fault tree analysis has been a primary method of determining safety of a system and showing the behavior of the system (with respect to its requirements) in the presence of faults~\cite{0f356f05e72f43018211b36f97c8854a,vesely1981fault}. Fault tree analysis requires one to explore the faults of the system and their effects on system behavior to determine minimal fault configurations -- \emph{minimal cut sets} -- that may violate requirements. From the beginning of fault tree analysis in the '60's, algorithms worked directly with the fault tree structure to produce minimal cut sets~\cite{10020219108,semanderes1971elraft}. As the years progressed, it was clear that this approach could not sufficiently address the problem of computation time. In 1993, Rauzy et al. developed a new approach that converted the fault tree structure into a binary decision diagram (BDD)~\cite{rauzy1993new}. This was a natural way to reduce the Boolean formula into something far more computationally efficient and reduceable to even simpler forms. Numerous algorithms were developed to perform variable ordering and minimization of the BDD; this resulted in better computation of MinCutSets and began the process of automating a complex manual safety analysis task~\cite{sinnamon1997new,bryant1986graph,aralia1996computation,reay2002fault,rauzy2007assessment}. BDDs are still commonly used to perform quantitative and qualitative fault tree analysis~\cite{ge2015quantitative,jiang2018algebraic,banov2019new}.
