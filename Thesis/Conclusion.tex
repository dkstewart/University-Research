System safety analysis is crucial in the development of critical systems and the generation of accurate and useful results is invaluable to the assessment process. Having multiple ways to capture complex dependencies between faults and the behavior of the system in the presence of these faults is important throughout the development process. A model-based approach was proposed that allows for a tighter integration between system development and safety analysis. The existing system model is extended and safety specific definitions and information can be defined at all levels of the model architecture (e.g., software, hardware, system level, module level). This extended model, or fault model, can be analyzed using a model checker and various safety related artifacts can be generated. These include snapshots of the state of the system when a fault is active (automatically generated counterexamples), maximum active fault thresholds, and minimal cut sets. 

We also provided a formalization of the compositional generation of minimal cut sets through the use of inductive validity cores. This will open the door for future research work into more scalable options of minimal cut set generation through the use of SMT-solvers and possibly other verification engines. An introductory exploration into the concepts of granularity and mutation testing provides a framework for the application of other kinds of formal methods techniques on a fault model and what kinds of important information can be gleaned from such analyses. 

There are multiple ways to view an extended system model and many ways to incorporate model checking theory into the information provided to a safety analyst; future work in this area holds promise. The key to this is clear communication with those in the practical field of safety analysis. It has been our goal to provide to safety analysts what they need and will use. Each step of this research has been discussed with analysts working in the aerospace domain and adjusted according to requirements of the field and needs of the analysts. We believe this is the key to moving from a research oriented methodology into the realm of applicable results in a critical system domain. 

All of this contributes to the long range goal of the research: to increase system safety through the support of MBSA process backed by formal methods to help safety engineers with early detection of design issues and automation of the artifacts required for certification.
