System safety analysis is crucial in the development of critical systems and the generation of accurate and scalable results is invaluable to the assessment process. Having multiple ways to capture complex dependencies between faults and the behavior of the system in the presence of these faults is important throughout the entire process. 

This research leverages the compositional generation of minimal inductive validity cores in order to transform them into minimal cut sets for a fault model. We also explore how the specification of contracts can change the results of this analysis and provide algorithms that provide granular refinement of the model. 

This dissertation work includes the development and implementation of the Safety Annex for AADL.  The Safety Annex provides a way to capture complex relationships between faults in a model and analyze their effects behaviorally through either compositional or monolithic analysis.
