To my Grandfather, Leal:% I survived you. You did your very best to ruin me, but you failed. You simultaneously did your best to raise me to be an intelligent, wise, and truthful woman. This you succeeded in. 

% It was a strange moment when after months of struggle, the committee made your birthday my day of defense. It was perfectly fitting---one of those synchronous moments that seem to follow me. Another was the day I got my first horse, Nicholas. That was also on your birthday. 

% The cruelest and darkest moments of my life, you saw. You were there and you created them. You almost killed me in more ways than one. But here I am. People have said that I am not who I am because of you, but I know they are wrong. You helped shaped me into me. If I could go back in time and make it all different, I couldn't... it would be suicide. I would be fundamentally different. And I like who I am. I like what came of that mess. 

% Yet at the same time, I wish things could have been different. I wish you would have been a good grandfather. You are the monster under my bed and I will love you for the rest of my life. Strange, isn't it. 

% This work is for you. I close the page on this chapter of my life, but never on the chapter of you. You weave your way through my every day and that is okay. You are part of me.
