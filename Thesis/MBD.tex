\subsubsection{Architecture Analysis and Design Language}
We are using the Architectural Analysis and Design Language (AADL) to construct system architecture models.  AADL is an SAE International standard language that provides a unifying framework for describing the system architecture for performance-critical, embedded, real-time systems~\cite{AADL_Standard,FeilerModelBasedEngineering2012}. From its conception, AADL has been designed for the design and construction of avionics systems.  Rather than being merely descriptive, AADL models can be made specific enough to support system-level code generation.  Thus, results from analyses conducted, including the new safety analysis proposed here, correspond to the system that will be built from the model.  
 
An AADL model describes a system in terms of a hierarchy of components and their interconnections, where each component can either represent a logical entity (e.g., application software functions, data) or a physical entity (e.g., buses, processors). An AADL model can be extended with language annexes to provide a richer set of modeling elements for various system design and analysis needs (e.g., performance-related characteristics, configuration settings, dynamic behaviors). The language definition is sufficiently rigorous to support formal analysis tools that allow for early phase error/fault detection.

For these reasons, we chose this modeling language as a foundational element of the model-based safety assessment research conducted for this dissertation.
