\section{Algorithms and Results}
The exploration of contractual granularity and its effect on analysis results was performed through the automation of contractual refinement. The algorithms and descriptions of results can be found in the following two subsections.. %All experimental results were run on a group of \danielle{describe benchmarks}.

\input{granularityANDAlg}
\input{granularityFRESHAlg}
