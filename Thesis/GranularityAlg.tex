\section{Algorithms and Results}
The approache taken to explore contractual granularity and how it may affect analysis results was through the automation of contractual refinement. The algorithms and descriptions of results can be found in Sections~\ref{sec:granularityANDAlg} and \ref{sec:granularityFRESHAlg}. All experimental results were run on a group of \danielle{15?} AADL models annotated with AGREE contracts and fault models defined using the safety annex. The size of the models ranged from single layer with two instantiated components up to 5 layers with over 200 component instances.
