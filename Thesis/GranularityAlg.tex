\section{Algorithms and Results}
There were two main approaches that were taken to explore contractual granularity and how it may affect analysis results. The first approach was to automate contractual refinement and test results. The algorithms and descriptions of results can be found in Sections~\ref{sec:granularityANDAlg} and \ref{sec:granularityFRESHAlg}. The second approach included the use of {\em mutation} testing to find critical equations and contracts in the model, as well as critical node inputs. These results can be found in Sections~\ref{sec:granularityMutationEq} and \ref{sec:granularityMutationInputs}. 

All experimental results were run on a group of 15 AADL models annotated with AGREE contracts and fault models defined using the safety annex. The size of the models ranged from single layer with three instantiated components up to 5 layers with over 200 component instances.
