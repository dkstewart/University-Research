\chapter{Fault Modeling and the Safety Annex}
\label{chap:faultModeling}
Early on in Section~\ref{subsec:mbsa}, a model-based safety assessment process was proposed. This process was backed by formal methods and incorporates a shared model into the development and safety analysis processes. A high level description of this cyclical process is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SACycle} for your convenience.

There are certain capabilities that are required in order to fully perform all steps of this process. In beginning this research, we outlined what those pieces were and investigated related work to determine if a gap still existed. Based on the related work summary found in Section~\ref{sec:modelCheckingInSA}, it can be seen that this research attempts to fill certain gaps in the field of safety analysis.

In this chapter, the fault modeling process using the safety annex for the Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL)~\cite{AADL_Standard} is described. The safety annex was developed with these two broad ideas in mind: (1) how this annex can support the proposed safety assessment process, and (2) what are the gaps in current related safety analysis tools that can be closed with this research.

\section{Fault, Failure, and Error Terminology}
The usage of the terms error, failure, and fault are defined in ARP4754A and are described here for ease of understanding~\cite{SAE:ARP4754A}. An \textit{error} is a mistake made in implementation, design, or requirements. A \textit{fault} is the manifestation of an error and a \textit{failure} is an event that occurs when the delivered service of a system deviates from correct behavior. If a fault is activated under the right circumstances, that fault can lead to a failure. The terminology used in the Error Model Annex version 2 for AADL (EMV2)~\cite{EMV2}, differs slightly for an error: an error is a corrupted state caused by a fault. The error propagates through a system and can manifest as a failure. In this dissertation, we use the ARP4754A terminology with the added definition of \textit{error propagation} as used in EMV2. An error is a mistake made in design or code and an error propagation is the propagation of the corrupted state caused by an active fault.

\section{Component Fault Modeling in the Safety Annex}
The safety annex is used to add possible faulty behaviors to a component model. When a fault is activated by its specified triggering conditions, it modifies the output of the component. This erroneous behavior may violate the contracts of other components in the system, including assumptions of downstream components. The impact of an active fault is computed by the AGREE model checker when the safety analysis is run on the fault model. 

When given a nominal model with which to perform safety analysis, the analyst must associate faults with each component. Examples of such faults include valves being stuck open or closed, output of a software component being nondeterministic, or power being cut off. These are often determined based on hardware specification guidelines and domain expertise. Returning to the PWR running example, each sensor for each subsystem may fail to indicate that the threshold has been surpassed. If the radiation levels are high and the radiation sensor reports no such indication, this is a fault that must be considered during analysis. 

As an illustration of fault modeling using the safety annex, we look at one of the components important to the PWR system level safety property: the radiation sensor.  If the radiation levels are high, the radiaton sensor reports this through an indicator to the radiation sensor subsystem. A shut down command will be sent to the top level. Figure~\ref{fig:radiationSensor} shows the AADL pedal sensor component with a contract for its nominal behavior. The sensor has only one input, the environmental radiation, and one output, the high radiation levels indication. The property that governs the behavior of the component is that the radiation sensor will indicate when the threshold is reached.

	\end{center}
	%\vspace{-0.2in}
\end{figure}

One possible failure for this sensor is inversion of its output value; the radiation levels are actually above threshold, but the sensor does not indicate such. This fault can be triggered with probability $1.0\times 10^{-5}$\footnote{In practice, the component failure probability is 
collected from hardware specification sheets.}. The safety annex definition for this fault is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:radiationSensorFault}. Fault behavior is defined through the use of a fault node called \textit{stuck\_false} (shown in Figure~\ref{fig:stuckFalseNode}).  When the fault is triggered, the nominal output of the component (\textit{High\_Radiation\_Indicator}) is replaced with its failure value (\textit{val\_out}).

	\end{center}
	%\vspace{-0.2in}
\end{figure}

Similar faults can be defined for all sensors in the PWR system. These may include stuck high (sensor reports high when threshold is not reached), stuck low (sensor does not report high when threshold is reached), etc.

\end{figure}

Given the complexity of systems, there are many types of faults that correspond to various components. The safety annex allows for complex fault behavior to be modeled through the node definitions and this can benefit safety analysts from numerous disciplines. The majority of faults that are connected to outputs of components are known as \textit{symmetric}. That is, whatever components receive this faulty output will receive the same faulty output value. Thus, this output is seen symmetrically. An alternative fault type is \textit{asymmetric}. This pertains to a component with a 1-n output: one output which is sent to many receiving components. For more information on modeling asymmetric faults, see Section~\ref{sec:byzantine}. %This fault can present itself differently to the receiving components. For instance, in a boolean setting, one component might see a true value and the rest may see false. This is also possible to model using the keyword \textit{asymmetric}. For more details on fault definitions and fault modeling capabilities, we refer readers to the Safety Annex Users Guide\cite{SAGithub}.



\section{Error Propagation}
As systems become larger and more complex, it can be difficult knowing all possible error propagations within a model; using a purely explicit approach to error propagation is difficult. To this end, we developed the safety annex to primarily use \textit{behavioral} propagation. In this approach, the faults are attached to a component's output and ``turned on" in a manner of speaking. The effects and propagation of the active fault is revealed through the behavioral contracts of the system by use of the model checker. 

This section outlines the safety annex's approach to implicit error propagation and also describes how one can model an explicit propagation by defining dependent faults. 

\subsection{Implicit Propagation}
In the approach primarily used in the safety annex, faults are captured as faulty behaviors that augment the system behavioral model in AGREE contracts. No explicit error propagation is necessary since the faulty behavior itself propagates through the system just as in the nominal system model. The effects of any triggered fault are manifested through analysis of the AGREE contracts. In this way, the safety analysis is closely tied to the behavior model of components and their requirements; the analysis is focused on the system dynamics and interactions. 

In the PWR running example, all error propagations are defined implicitly. 

\begin{comment}
On the contrary, in the AADL Error Model Annex, Version 2 (EMV2)~\cite{EMV2} approach, all errors must be explicitly propagated through each component (by applying fault types on each of the output ports) in order for a component to have an impact on the rest of the system. To illustrate the key differences between implicit %failure
error propagation provided in the safety annex and the explicit %failure 
error propagation provided in EMV2, we use a simplified behavioral flow from the WBS example using code fragments from EMV2, AGREE, and the safety annex. 

\begin{figure}[h]
	%\hspace*{-2cm}

	\includegraphics[trim=0 9 0 5,clip,width=\textwidth]{images/Comparison_with_EMV2.pdf}
	%\vspace{-0.3in}
	\caption{Differences between safety annex and EMV2}
	\label{fig:comparison_with_EMV2}
	%\vspace{-0.2in}
\end{figure} 

In this simplified WBS system, the physical signal from the pedal component is detected by the sensor and the pedal position value is passed to the Braking System Control Unit (BSCU) components.  The BSCU generates a pressure command to the valve component which applies hydraulic brake pressure to the wheels. 

In the EMV2 approach (top half of Figure~\ref{fig:comparison_with_EMV2}), the ``NoService'' fault is explicitly propagated through all of the components. These fault types are essentially tokens that do not capture any analyzable behavior. At the system level, analysis tools supporting the EMV2 annex can aggregate the propagation information from different components to compose an overall fault flow diagram or fault tree. 

When a fault is triggered in the safety annex (bottom half of Figure~\ref{fig:comparison_with_EMV2}), the output behavior of the sensor component is modified. In this case the result is a ``stuck at zero'' error. The behavior of the BSCU receives a zero input and proceeds as if the pedal has not been pressed. This will cause the top level system contract to fail: {\em pedal pressed implies brake pressure output is positive}.
\end{comment}


\subsection{Explicit Propagation} 
Failures in hardware (HW) components can trigger behavioral faults in the system components that depend on them. For example, a CPU failure may trigger faulty behavior in the threads bound to that CPU. In addition, a failure in one HW component may trigger failure in other HW components located nearby, such as overheating, fire, or explosion
in the containment location. The safety annex provides the capability to explicitly model the impact of hardware failures on other faults, behavioral or non behavioral. 

To better model faults at the system level dependent on HW failures, a fault model element is introduced called a \textit{hardware fault}. Users are not required to specify behavioral effects for the HW faults, nor are data ports necessary on which to apply the fault definition. An example of a hardware fault declaration is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hwFault} and describes a possible failure occurring between two co-located pumps. 
\begin{figure}[h!]
	%\vspace{-0.1in}
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{images/hw_fault2.png}
	\end{center}
	\vspace{-0.1in}
	\caption{Hardware Fault Definition}
	\label{fig:hwFault}
	%\vspace{-0.2in}
	%\vspace{-0.1in}
\end{figure}


Users specify dependencies between the HW component faults and faults that are defined in other components, either HW or SW. The hardware fault then acts as a trigger for dependent faults. This allows a simple propagation from the faulty HW component to the SW components that rely on it, affecting the behavior on the outputs of the affected SW components.

Assume that there exist a green and a blue hydraulic pump; these are located in the same compartment in the aircraft and an explosion in this compartment rendered both pumps inoperable. 
The HW fault definition can be modeled first in the green hydraulic pump component as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hwFault}. The activation of this fault triggers the activation of related faults as seen in the \textit{propagate\_to} statement shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hwFaultProp}. 
Notice that these pumps need not be connected through a data port in order to specify this propagation. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
	%\vspace{-0.1in}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{images/hw_prop_stmt.png}
	\end{center}
	\vspace{-0.1in}
	\caption{Hardware Fault Propagation Statement}
	\label{fig:hwFaultProp}
	%\vspace{-0.2in}
	%\vspace{-0.1in}
\end{figure}

By allowing both kinds of error propagation, this allows great flexibility in modeling and allows an analyst to capture multiple kinds of faults. 


\section{Fault Hypothesis}
The fault hypothesis (also referred to as the fault analysis statement) resides in the AADL system implementation that is selected for verification. This may specify either a maximum number of faults that can be active at any point in execution:

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\vspace{-0.1in}
	%\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{images/hypothesisMaxN.png}
	%\end{center}
	\vspace{-0.1in}
	%%\caption{Max N Faults Analysis Statement}
	\label{fig:hypothesisMaxN}
\end{figure}
or that the only faults to be considered are those whose probability of simultaneous occurrence is above some probability threshold: 

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\vspace{-0.1in}
	%\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/hypothesisProb.png}
	%\end{center}
	\vspace{-0.1in}
	%\caption{Probability Analysis Statement}
	%\label{fig:hypothesisProb}
\end{figure}

Tying back to the fault tree analysis in traditional safety analysis, the former is analogous to restricting the cut sets to a specified maximum number of terms, and the latter is analogous to restricting the cut sets to only those whose probability is above some set value. In the former case, we assert that the sum of the true {\em fault\_\_trigger} variables is at or below some integer threshold.  In the latter, we determine all combinations of faults whose probabilities are above the specified probability threshold, and describe this as a proposition over {\em fault\_\_trigger} variables. 
%
With the introduction of dependent faults, active faults are divided into two categories: independently active (activated by its own triggering event) and dependently active (activated when the faults they depend on become active). The top level fault hypothesis applies to independently active faults. Faulty behaviors augment nominal behaviors whenever their corresponding faults are active (either independently active or dependently active).
