\chapter{Preliminaries and Related Work}
\label{chap:prelim}
Safety analysis plays an important role in the development of critical systems; it is through the safety assessment process that safety engineers and certification authorities are convinced that the system under consideration satisfies its safety requirements. In this chapter, we describe the high level safety assessment process that is used in the avionics industry, and then we introduce model-based safety assessment as an alternate approach to the safety process. In addition, because the main contributions of this work rely heavily on formal methods of analysis, the background and key ideas of formal methods are presented. This is followed by a brief review of closely related work in model-based safety analysis.
