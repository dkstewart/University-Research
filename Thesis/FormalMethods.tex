\section{Formal Methods of Verification and Validation}
\label{sec:fm}
As the complexity of systems increase, the cost of development and validation consumes more time and resources than ever before; nevertheless, these processes are vital in safety critical systems when the loss of functionality of the system can result in loss of life. Authorities have put in place various thresholds for the likelihood of such events and it is the responsibility of the system developers to show that this is incredibly unlikely to occur~\cite{faaSA}. Utilizing the recent advancements in automated formal verification within the validation process has become essential to the certification of critical systems~\cite{deptOfDefense,standard1999,prasad2005survey}. This section provides a summary of the formal method techniques that are commonly used in the system development and safety assessment processes.
