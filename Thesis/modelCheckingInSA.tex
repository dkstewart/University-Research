\section{Model Checking in Safety Analysis: A Brief History and the State of the Practice}
\label{sec:modelCheckingInSA}
Safety analysis has traditionally been performed manually, but with the rise of model checking and the improvement of its capabilities, the world of safety analysis began to see its powerful benefits~\cite{hinchey2012industrial, liggesmeyer1998improving, coudert1993fault, Bozzano:2010:DSA:1951720,bozzano2003esacs}. There arose multiple ways of viewing the system and fault models, various ways of automating the capture of safety pertinant information, and a number of tools that addressed various issues that arose. In this section, we discuss the state of the practice and how formal methods has been applied in the domain of safety assessment.
